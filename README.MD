Project Idea: Real-Time Task Collaboration App
Description: Build a fullstack web application that allows users to create, manage, and collaborate on tasks in real-time. Users can:

Register/login to manage personal task boards.
Create, update, or delete tasks with details like title, description, status, and due date.
Collaborate with others by sharing boards and seeing real-time updates (e.g., when someone adds or completes a task).
View a dashboard with task statistics (e.g., completed vs. pending tasks).
Why Build This?

Go Backend: Practice building a REST API with Goâ€™s net/http or a framework like gin, using goroutines for concurrent processing and WebSockets for real-time updates.
React Frontend: Leverage your fullstack skills to create a responsive UI with React, integrating with the Go API and handling real-time events via WebSockets.
Real-World Relevance: Mimics tools like Trello or Asana, combining CRUD operations, authentication, and real-time collaboration.
Scalable: Start simple (CRUD API) and add advanced features like WebSockets, authentication, or analytics.
Tech Stack:

Backend: Go (with gin for routing, gorilla/websocket for real-time, and sqlx for database queries).
Frontend: React (with Tailwind CSS for styling and axios for API calls).
Database: PostgreSQL (or SQLite for simplicity) to store users, tasks, and boards.
Authentication: JWT for secure user sessions.
Real-Time: WebSockets for live task updates.
Key Go Skills:

HTTP Server: Build REST endpoints with gin.
Goroutines: Handle concurrent API requests or WebSocket connections.
WebSockets: Use gorilla/websocket for real-time updates.
Database: Query PostgreSQL with sqlx for structured data.
JWT: Implement token-based authentication.
Error Handling: Manage API errors idiomatically.
Key Frontend Skills:

React Components: Build reusable UI components (e.g., task cards, forms).
State Management: Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) or Redux for complex state.
API Integration: Fetch data with axios and update UI dynamically.
WebSocket Client: Handle real-time updates with the WebSocket API.

Core Features
User Authentication:
Register: POST /register (email, password).
Login: POST /login (returns JWT).
Protect routes with JWT middleware.
Task Management:
Create: POST /tasks (title, description, due date, status).
List: GET /tasks (filter by status or board).
Update: PUT /tasks/:id (edit task details).
Delete: DELETE /tasks/:id.
Collaboration:
Create boards: POST /boards (group tasks into boards).
Share boards: Invite users via email or ID.
Real-time updates: Notify all board members when tasks change.
Dashboard:
Display task counts (e.g., completed, pending).
Visualize progress with a simple chart (e.g., using Chart.js).
